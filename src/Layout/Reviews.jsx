Ricky was always available to answer questions or address concerns and did a great job letting us know when everything would be scheduled.",

    "Ricky Enriquez is the best! When I was on a road trip and my car broke down in Goldthwaite on a Saturday afternoon, a super-helpful lady at the Chamber of Commerce said Let me call this really nice guy I know, maybe he can help you out.  Ricky came to a stranger's aid, looked over my engine and helped get me on my way.  If I lived in town I'd use him for any construction I needed because he's just a solid, trustworthy guy!"
